Research innovation is increasingly being driven by techniques that require access to advanced computing and knowledge of software development. This dependency on computational infrastructures creates a competency gap between researchers' that supply domain knowledge of data and engineers that develop software to process data. The NeIC competency development initiative CodeRefinery and our sister organization Software Carpentry target this gap by teaching good programming practice and software development for research. We aim to help researchers and students to get their work done in less time and with less pain by teaching them how to write better code and provide research groups with software development e-infrastructure tools to collaboratively develop, review, discuss, test, and share their codes.

The workshop combines insights and teachings from CodeRefinery and Software Carpentry in order to raise awareness of both initiatives. We tailor the workshop to specific needs of the humanities. Researchers, students, educators, and librarians will all find the workshop relevant to their specific interests. The workshop focuses on hands-on experience and will cover basic concepts and tools, including program design, version control, and task automation. The core lessons of the workshop are the Software Carpentry' Programming with Python and CodeRefinery's Introduction to Version Control with Git.

## About us ##
CodeRefinery is a project within the Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (NeIC) that offers training workshops to researchers from Nordic research groups and projects in using state-of-the-art tools and practices from modern collaborative software engineering. Our workshops focus on methods to build modular, reusable, maintainable, sustainable, reproducible, testable, and robust software.

Since 1998, Software Carpentry has been teaching researchers the computing skills they need to get more done in less time and with less pain. Our volunteer instructors have run hundreds of events for over 22,000 researchers since 2012. All of our lesson materials are freely reusable under the Creative Commons - Attribution license.

[**Kristoffer Laigaard Nielbo**](https://knielbo.github.io//), kln(AT)cas(DOT)au(DOT)dk),
is Carpentries instructor, CodeRefinery SG member, and associate professor of humanities computing at University of Southern Denmark, where he runs an eScience unit for the humanities in the SDU eScience Center. KLN has specialized in applications of quantitative methods and computational tools in analysis, interpretation and storage of cultural data. He has participated in a range of collaborative and interdisciplinary research projects involving researchers from the humanities, social sciences, health science, and natural sciences. His research covers two areas of interest of which one is more recent (automated text analysis) and the other (modeling of cultural behavior) has followed him during his entire academic career. Both interests explore the cultural information space in new and innovative ways by combining cultural data and humanities theories with statistics, computer algorithms, and visualization.
